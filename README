Linux kernel
============

This file was moved to Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst

Please notice that there are several guides for kernel developers and users.
These guides can be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.

ReGinkgo Kernel: The Legend Reborn for Redmi Note 8

The Redmi Note 8 (ginkgo) has always been a beloved device in the custom development community, but to truly unlock its potential, you need more than just a standard setup. Enter ReGinkgo Kernel, the definitive revival of the iconic FitaKernel.

Born from the legacy of one of the most respected kernels in the scene, ReGinkgo isn't just a simple update—it is a complete reconstruction designed to bring modern performance standards to a classic device.
Why ReGinkgo Stands Out

ReGinkgo is engineered for users who refuse to settle for "good enough." By inheriting the stability and optimization logic of FitaKernel and injecting it with contemporary enhancements, this kernel transforms the Redmi Note 8 into a performance powerhouse.

    Optimized Efficiency: Experience smoother UI transitions and eliminated micro-stutters.

    Enhanced Battery Longevity: Sophisticated power management that ensures your device lasts through the day without sacrificing speed.

    Thermal Control: Intelligent throttling algorithms that keep the Snapdragon 665 cool even under heavy workloads.

    Gaming Prowess: Reduced latency and improved frame stability for a competitive edge.

The Future is Fast: The 2.5GHz Milestone

The journey doesn't stop here. The development roadmap for ReGinkgo is pushing the boundaries of what the hardware can handle.

We are excited to announce that a new version is coming soon, featuring a massive overclock to 2.5GHz. This update aims to squeeze every drop of raw power out of the silicon, providing a level of snappiness and processing speed previously thought impossible for the Redmi Note 8.

Whether you are a hardcore gamer, a power user, or someone who just wants their phone to feel brand new again, ReGinkgo Kernel is the ultimate upgrade.
